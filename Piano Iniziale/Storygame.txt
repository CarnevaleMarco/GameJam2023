1 OPENING IMAGE - (Light Versus Dark )
From darkness, an enlighted sword comes, and its light makes its way through it.
But the sword gets eaten from the darkness, and every struggle that seemed good, is vane.

2 THEME STATE 
Infinite darkness is coming, to extinguish the grand light on the highest peek, that like a sun can always be seen.
So when no being will be reached, darkness will extablish chains under its control. 

3 SETUP
Our hero now lives in the underground, like most people, not to be blinded from both dark and light.
No one escaped before our hero, by its free will. He did it to prove his freedom to the destiny of the underground.

4CATALYST
He went in the darkest of all caves, searching for the only known exit, and went lost in absolute darkness.
Alone, doubtful whether to go on, a shining light led him to a discovery that could help him break free.
He found the way to continue: a weighty sword he could barely lift, devinely enlighted by itself.
