DarkenLight - GameOff 2023 GameJam project

A game with the theme of SCALE.

To install: 
Unzip the .zip file, open 'windows' file, start playing with 'GameOff2023.exe'

Usage:
E to hide, L/R mouse to attack and cure, WASD to move

You can leave a review on the Itch.io page of the game.

I could continue the project, as this is full of bugs to fix and other major things.

Authors and acknowledgment:
I want to thank so much Beccapotamus and Aur√©lien Montero for the sound effects and music in the game, as I integrated their sound packs into the game.

Project status
Extreme prototype of a game I planned too much, in fact I started coding in the second half of the Jam.
You can contribute with a review, I would appreciate if you are honest with it, please be judgeful.

Thank for reading!
